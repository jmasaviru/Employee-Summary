 ## Usage
  The application prompts the user to build a team consisting of a manager, intern(s) and engineer(s). The user answers the prompt questions on the terminal which then generates a team.html page in the output directory.

  The application also makes use of validation in order to make sure the user only inputs allowed character values as the 'name', 'id' and 'email' in order to prevent errors.
